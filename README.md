# Hello Angel

This repo demonstrates a minimal working [Angel](https://angel-dart.github.io/) project.

## Intro

Angel *per se* is a nice Dart web framework; however, it is a bit under-documented. In addition, default Angel boilerplate project bundles with MongoDB, which is a bit misleading since many web applications don't use MongoDB.  This repo loosely follow Angel from scratch examples, making it a working sample project without tieing to any database.

## Usage

```
# Get this repo.
$ git clone https://github.com/cwchentw/hello_angel_mvc.git
$ cd hello_angel_mvc

# Start with `angel`.
$ angel start

# Start with Dart.
$ dart bin/server.dart
```
